Interview Java


Q)Run java file from terminal

	Before Java-11 version
		>javac filename.java
		>java filename
		
	Java-11 and higher version
		>java filename.java

Q)Difference between JDK, JRE and JVM

 JDK and JRE are platform-dependent, but we can compile and run in different system.

	JDK - Java Development Kit
		It is a platform dependent
		It contains JVM & JRE, javac compiler, Java docs and other libraries which help us to create an application.
		Libraries:- javac compiler, java doc, java debugger
	
	JRE - Java Runtime Environament
		It is used to run the java application
		JRE is a physical implementation of the JVM.
		It contains JIT compiler which is used to convert bytecode into binary code (machine code)
		Libraries:- java lang, util, collections, math, regEx, classloader
		
	
	JVM - Java Virtual Environament
		The JIT compiler is part of the JVM, not the JDK.
		It is a platform dependent. Different JVM is designed for different OS and byte code is able to run on different OS.
		JVM is physically not exist and can't be installed alone. JVM is a part of JRE, we need to install JRE
		It enables the execution of Java bytecode. The JVM acts as an interpreter between the Java programming language and the underlying hardware.
		It provides a runtime environment for Java applications to run on different platforms and operating systems.
	

	
Q)Can we run jar or bytecode with out installing jre
Yes, we can, but we need JRE extracted files from jre zip, then navigate to jre\bin\java.exe -jar executable-file.jar

Q)JDK 11
jre is no longer offered in JDK 11

Q)OpenJdk vs Oracale/RedHat JDK
Open jdk - It an open source project that is maintained by Oracale, RedHat and community

Oracale/RedHat JDK - It is licensed one 

Q)If Open JDK is free then why do we need licensed jdk like Oracale and RedHat 
Becaue vendor provide some support and bug fixes etc.
Long-Term Support (LTS)
Security

Q)Memories in java
	Heap memory:	
		-used to store the objects/instance data
		-Objects stored in the heap are globally accessible.
		-The instance variable will be stored in a heap as part of object data
		-Whenever you create an object, it is always stored in the heap space. 
	stack memory:
		-Stack memory only contains method call sequence, local primitive and reference variables to objects in heap space.
		-Method variables stored in stack memory
		-Stack memory is used only by one thread of execution, Other threads can’t access stack memory.
		
Q)Generations 
	It is a segment of Heap memory used to group objects based on their age and lifecycle (for sake of garbage collection).
	
	1)Young Generation:
		This is where all new objects are allocated and aged.
		Hold short-lived objects.
		Takes less time for GC.
		Ex:  Temporary variables, Method-local objects, Loop variables, Request-scope objects
	
	2)Old or Tenured Generation:
		this is where long-surviving objects are stored.
		Hold long-lived objects.
		Takes more time for GC.
		Ex: Singleton instances, Caches, User sessions, Thread pools, Global or static objects
	
	3)Permanent Generation:
		this consists of JVM metadata for the runtime classes and application methods.
		
Q)Types of Garbage collector
	JVM has four types of GC implementations:
	1)Serial Garbage Collector
		->The Serial Garbage Collector is the simplest and oldest garbage collector in Java. It uses a single thread to perform garbage collection, making it suitable for single-threaded applications or small-scale applications with limited memory.
		->Used until java-8
		->If you want to use serial garbage collector, then we have to explicitly mention while running jar like: >java -XX:+UseSerialGC -jar Application.java 
	
	2)Parallel Garbage Collector
		->It’s the default GC of the JVM from Java 5 until Java 8
		->It uses multiple threads to perform cleaning of unused heap area.
		->java -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:ParallelGCThreads=NumberOfThreads -jar Application.java
		->java -XX:+UseParallelGC -jar Application.java //Java 9
	
	3)CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep) Garbage Collector
		->This garbage collector uses multiple threads to scan the heap memory consistently to the mark objects that are unused and then sweep the marked objects. 
		->If we compare CMS collector with Parallel garbage collector, CMS collector uses more CPU to ensure better application throughput.
		->java -XX:+UseParNewGC -jar Application.java
	
	4)G1 Garbage Collector
		->Firstly G1 Garbage Collector is introduced in JDK 7
		->G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector is designed for applications running on multi-processor machines with large memory space. 
		->java -XX:+UseG1GC -jar Application.java

Q)Default garbage collector

	Java 7 - Parallel GC
	Java 8 - Parallel GC
	Java 9 - G1 GC
	Java 10 - G1 GC
	java 11 - G1 GC

P)In Java, all the wrapper classes (like Integer, Boolean, Byte, Short, Float, Double, Long) and String class is immutable.
	we can also create a custom immutable class- it should contain only constructor/builder and getters, no setters.

1)Object class
	The Object class is the parent class of all the classes in java by default. In other words, it is the topmost class of java.
	
	Methods:-
		getClass()
		equals() - compares the given object to this object.
		hashCode() - method is a part of the Object class and is used to return an integer value, which is a hash code representation of the object. This method plays a crucial role in the functioning of hash-based collections like HashMap, HashSet, and Hashtable.
		toString() - returns the string representation of this object
		finalize() - It is invoked by the garbage collector before object is being garbage collected.
		
Q)Use of finalize() method
It is invoked by the garbage collector before destroy the object. It is used to release the resources and clean up.

Q)How memory leaks can be happen
A Memory Leak is a situation where there are objects present in the heap that are no longer used, but the garbage collector is unable to remove them from memory
	
	Types of memory leaks
	1)Memory Leak Through static Fields
		In Java, static fields have a life that usually matches the entire lifetime of the running application (unless ClassLoader becomes eligible for garbage collection).
		Ex:- 
	public class StaticFieldsMemoryLeakUnitTest {
			public static List<Double> list = new ArrayList<>();

			public void populateList() {
				for (int i = 0; i < 10000000; i++) {
            list.add(Math.random());
			}
		}

	2)Whenever the unused connection or resources are not closed/terminated. Ex: File resource, DB connection sessions
		Whenever we make a new connection or open a stream, the JVM allocates memory for these resources. A few examples of this include database connections, input streams, and session objects.
	3)When the garbage collection takes more time.

Q)How to increase the java heap memory size 
java -Xms512m -Xmx1024m TestData.java

-Xms: initial heap size
-Xmx: Maximum heap size 

Q)What is generics
generics enable types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces and methods
It provide type safty, it hold only one type of object.
Before generics, we can store any type of objects in the collection, i.e., non-generic. Now generics force the java programmer to store a specific type of objects.

Q)Does importing of com.myMainPackage.* also import com.myMainPackage.mySubPackage.*?
   NO, Importing the parent package only results in the import of the classes within it and not the contents of its child/sub-packages. Importing of the sub-packages of a package needs to be done explicitly.



Q)What is functional interface
An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method. SAM (Single abstract method).
Ex:-
	Runnable -> run()
	Comparable  -> compareTo()


Q)Integer cache
Java keeps an integer cache of integer instances in range of -128 to 127, like integer pool.
Cache is applicable for Integer=18 and Integer.valueOf(18). Not applicable of Integer i = new Integer(10), because "new" always creates a new object in Heap memory.

java.lang.Long has a cache for long between -128 to +127.
Integer i1 == Integer i2 ==> true if range is b/w -128 and 127, false if value is beyond that
Ex:- Integer i1=60, i2=60 => i1==i2 //true (it check the reference and reference is same)
	Integer i1=500, i2=500 => i1==i2 //false (it check the reference and reference is different)

Q)Is there any difference in defining or creating a String by using String literal and by using the new() operator?
Creating string using the new operator ensures that the String is created in the heap alone and not into the string pool. Whereas, creating string using literal ensures that the string is created in the string pool. String pool exists as part of the perm area in the heap. This ensures that the multiple Strings created using literal having same values are pointed to one object and prevents duplicate objects with the same value from being created.

P)The String Pool in Java is a special memory area located in the heap

Q)Difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder

String:-
The String class is immutable. (cannot change the object).
String is slow and consumes more memory when we concatenate too many strings because every time it creates new instance
String class is slower while performing concatenation operation
String class overrides the equals() method of Object class. So you can compare the contents of two strings by equals() method
String class uses String constant pool

StringBuffer:-
The StringBuffer class is mutable.
StringBuffer is fast and consumes less memory when we concatenate n strings.
StringBuffer class is faster while performing concatenation operation than String 
StringBuffer class doesn't override the equals() method of Object class
StringBuffer always uses Heap memory
StringBuffer is called a thread safe class.

StringBuilder:-
StringBuilder is not a thread safe class.
StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer, because stringbuffer is synchronized and additional check is required

P)we cannot be able to invoke static method by objects like obj.metName().
P)override in static method does not make any sense, because static method belongs to class not to objects

Q)How many ways to create an object?
	Using new keyword - GFG obj = new GFG(); 
	Using new instance -  Class cls = Class.forName("GFG"); GFG obj = (GFG)cls.newInstance(); 
	Using clone() method - GFG obj2 = (GFG)obj1.clone(); 
	Using deserialization - 
	Using newInstance() method of Constructor class


Q)How is the ‘new’ operator different from the ‘newInstance()’ operator in java?
If we don’t know the class name for which we need to create the object, Or we get the class name from the command line argument, or the database, or the file. Then in that case we use the ‘newInstance()’ operator.

Student st = new Student() // Here we should know the class name

Class c = Class.forName("Student");  
Student st = (Student)c.newInstance();  


Q)What are shallow copy and deep copy in java?

Shallow copy:
	It copy the reference of one object to another, modifying on one object effect on another object.
	Person cloned = (Person) super.clone();

Deep copy:
	It stores copies of the object's value and modifying on one object doesn't effect on another object.
	@Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Person cloned = (Person) super.clone();
        cloned.address = (Address) address.clone(); // Clone the address
        return cloned;
    }
		
Q)Cloneable interfate 
	The default implementation of Java Object clone() method is using shallow copy.
		Ex:- class A implements Cloneable


2)Comparable and Comparator
Both are functional interface which contain SAM method.
	1)Comparable
		This funtional interface contain SAM compareTo() method.
		A comparable object is capable of comparing itself with another object.
		Here we can compare by only one member of class. (It affects the original class. i.e., actual class is altered.)
		Ex:- Collections.sort(listOfStudent);
		
		
	2)Comparator
		This funtional interface contain SAM compare() method. (It also contain equals() method but it not considered because this method exist in Object class)
		It’s a separate class. We create multiple separate classes (that implement Comparator) to compare by different members.
		Ex:- Collections.sort(myList, Comparator.reverseOrder());
			 listOfStudent.sort(new AgeComparator())
			 listOfStudent.sort(new NameComparator())
		
3)Singleton pattern with thread safe double check locking
--> Make class as final, so not able for inheretence
--> Make private constructor
--> make instance variable as volatile, so always value will be fetch from main memory not from cache

if (null == instance) {
	synchronized (SingletonClass.class) {
		if (null == instance) {
			instance = new SingletonClass();
		}
	}
}
return instance
		
		
Q)What is OOP's concept?
Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc

	Interface -It is a blueprint of a class
	Class - It is a template/blueprint of an object
	Object - It is an instance of class
	Inheritance - Aquring properties from one class (parent class) to another (child class).
		‘IS-A’ relationship is another name for inheritance. When we inherit the base class from the derived class, then it forms a relationship between the classes. 
		For ex:- bike and car inherits properties from vehical parent class, then here relationship is bike IS-A vehical.
		Java doesn't support multiple inheritance - to avoid the complexity and ambiguity that can arise from it.
		To avoid Diamond Problem.
		
	Polymorphism - task that performs a single action in different ways, one type manyforms.
		compiletime-polymorphism - Method overloading
		Runtime-polymorphism - method overriding (because object creates at runtime)
	Abstraction -  a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the use. Ex Interfaces and Abstract class - Can't able to create object to Abstract class
	Encapsulation - Wrapping of data (variable and method) into a single unit. Ex:- Class with private variable , getters and setters.

P)we can say that we cannot use this() and super() keywords in the same block, it will compilation error. super() should be first statement inside any constructor

P)IS-A and HAS-A (composition or aggregatio)
IS-A
	The "IS-A" relationship in Java refers to inheritance.
	bike ia Vehicle, car is a vehicle
HAS-A 
	car has engine
	car has tires

4)Multithreading

	In Java cannot be able to restart the thread, new instance will be required 

	Actually thread.start() creates a new thread and have its own execution scenario.
	but thread.run() not creating any new thread, instead it execute the run method in the current running thread just like invokation of normal thread.
	
	MIN_PRIORITY: It has an integer value assigned with 1.
	MAX_PRIORITY: It has an integer value assigned with 10.
	NORM_PRIORITY: It has an integer value assigned with 5.

The t1.join() method of thread class waits for a thread t1 to die (wait till t1 completes the work)

Multithreading:- Do multiple operation at same time with in the single application. Threads are lightweight processes within processes as seen. 

In java we can achieve by 2 types by extending Thread class and implementing Runnable interface. (Here it supports multiple inheritence)

EX:-
	A basic example of multithreading is downloading two files from two different tabs in a single web browser
	Spelling check in wordpad, The typing happens in Main thred and speelling check is happen on different thread (with low priority).
	In gaming application car, bike runs in different threads
	In youtube video is playing on one thread, comment, ads play in different threads.
	Multiple request & response process in a sigle web server.
	JUnits uses threads to run test cases in parallel
	
Q)Life cycle of java thread

	New
	Runnable
	Running
	Non-Runnable (Block/wait) - during synchronized block/methods
	Terminated
Multitasking/multi programming:- One user run multiple program in at same time called multitasking.
Multitasking is the ability of an operating system to run multiple tasks (processes) at the same time.
	
Multitasking
	Definition: Multitasking is the ability of an operating system to run multiple tasks (processes) at the same time.
	How It Works: The operating system manages multiple processes by allocating CPU time slices to each task. These time slices are so small that it appears as though the tasks are running simultaneously, but in reality, the CPU is rapidly switching between tasks.
	Ex:- running chrome, edge, youtube and MS word at same time
	
Multithreading
	Definition: Multithreading is the ability of a single process to manage multiple threads of execution within itself.
	How It Works: A single process can be divided into multiple threads, where each thread represents a separate path of execution. These threads share the same memory space but can execute independently.
	Ex: web servers, where each thread can handle a separate client request concurrently
	JUnits uses threads to run test cases in parallel
	
Thread obj.wait():-
	that causes the current thread to wait and go to sleep until some other threads call the notify () or notifyAll() method for the object’s monitor (lock). It simply releases the lock and is mostly used for inter-thread communication.
	It is defined in the object class, and should only be called from a synchronized context. 
	
Thread.sleep(100):-
	 it is a static method that pauses or stops the execution of the current thread for some specified period. It doesn’t release the lock while waiting and is mostly used to introduce pause on current execution.
	 It is defined in thread class, and no need to call from a synchronized context.

Q)Reentrent lock 
Reentrancy: A thread can acquire the same lock multiple times without causing a deadlock. For each call to lock(), there must be a corresponding call to unlock(), and the lock is only released when the number of unlocks matches the number of locks.
ReentrantLock can be configured to be fair. When fairness is set to true, the longest-waiting thread will acquire the lock next, ensuring first-come, first-served access.

Q)DIfference b/w Multithreading and Async


MultiThread:-

P)Daemon Thread & User Thread
The main difference between user thread and daemon thread is that JVM does not wait for daemon thread  before exiting while it do waits for the user thread.
Daemon thread is a low-priority thread that runs in the background.

Async:-
It doesn't wait for the response, 
Async programming is about non-blocking execution between functions

Q)What is excecuterService?
The ExecutorService interface simplifies the execution of asynchronous tasks, such as running tasks in parallel, scheduling tasks, and managing the lifecycle of tasks and threads.

Q)Java Threadpool
	Java Thread pool represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the job and reused many times.
	In the case of a thread pool, a group of fixed-size threads is created. A thread from the thread pool is pulled out and assigned a job by the service provider. After completion of the job, the thread is contained in the thread pool again.

Q)Java class execution flow
	static block 	//execution happens only once for static block, for others executiom/initialization happens for every object
	initialization of static variable
	main method()
	instance block
	initialization of class variable
	constructor

5)Design principals
SOLID principal
KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid ===> don't write complex methods
DRY - Don’t Repeat Yourself
YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It ---> don't write code based on assumption of future use



1)What is transient keyword and volatile

transient - it is used with variable. During serialization and deserialization the transient variable will skip. 
For example if we use [private tansient String password = "pwd123"] after serialize & deserialize the object the value of password will be null.
It helps us while sending the sensitive data over network
 
Q)What is an Array?
	An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. 
 
2)Collection framework
Collection is a framework that stores and manipulates a group of objects. 

Q)Difference b/w collection and collections
	Collection is called interface in java whereas Collections is called a utility class in java
	
	Collection - It is a interface implemented by List, set etc
	Collections - It is a utility class in java and it contain only static methods. Ex:- Collections.emptyList(), Collections.emptySet(), Collections.sort() etc.
 
2)List
 
	1)Arraylist
		The ArrayList class implements the List interface. It uses a dynamic array to store the duplicate element of different data types.
		Insertion and deletion operation is slow becasuse of shifting.
		Read data/accessing from index is fast beacause of contigous memeory allocation.
		Consumes less memeory compare to LinkedList
 
	2)LinkedList
	LinkedList implements the Collection interface. It uses a doubly linked list internally to store the elements. It can store the duplicate elements.
	insertion and deletion is fast.
	Data access is slow.
	Consumes more memory than ArrayList.
 
	3)Vector
	Vector uses a dynamic array to store the data elements. It is similar to ArrayList. However, It is synchronized and works in a multithreading environment
 
Q) How to make any LinkedList or ArrayList thread safe in java
-> 1. Using Collections.synchronizedList()
	List<String> list = new LinkedList<>(); // or ArrayList
    List<String> synchronizedList = Collections.synchronizedList(list);
	
->2. Using CopyOnWriteArrayList
	It also help us to avoid ConcurrentModificationException
	CopyOnWriteArrayList<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
	This class creates a new copy of the array every time a write operation (like add() or remove()) is performed.


4)Set
It represents the unordered set of elements which doesn't allow us to store the duplicate items.
	1)Hash Set
		It does't maintain any order. It is faster than all other sets. It internally uses HashMap to hold data.
	2)Linked Hash Set
		LinkedHashSet class represents the LinkedList implementation of Set Interface. Like HashSet, It also contains unique elements. It maintains the insertion order and permits null elements.
	3)TreeSet
		Java TreeSet class implements the Set interface that uses a tree for storage. The elements in TreeSet stored in ascending order.

5)Map
	1)HashMap
		
		It is a known fact that the HashMap key utilizes the hashCode() and the equals() method for finding the index and finding a key's value. Therefore, it is required to implement these methods properly. If these methods are not implemented properly, then hashMap will not work properly. 
	
		->HashMap in Java is basically an array of bucket where each bucket uses linked list to hold elements. A linked list is a list of nodes where each node contains a key-value pair(EntrySet).
		->The default initial capacity of HashMap is 16 (i.e. the number of buckets). and load factor is 75%
		->First the hascode of key will taken (for null key hascode will be 0) then pass that hashcode to hash() method it returns bucket location (int value). In that bucket key,value pair will be stored in LinkedList.
		->Time complexity to insert and retrieve a value is O(1)
		HashMap in Java 8 
		In Java 8, HashMap replaces the linked list with another useful data structure i.e. balanced trees (specifically red-black trees) tree on breaching a certain threshold, which is known as TREEIFY_THRESHOLD (size is 8, if bucket size/number of elements in a bucket is more than 8 link list become Red-Black tree). Once this threshold is reached, the linked list of Entries is converted to the Red-Black TreeNodes which reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(log(n)).
 
		TreeNodes are nothing but the structures supporting the balanced trees (specifically red-black trees) trees which have two nodes, smaller node goes to the left and the larger to the right. Whenever we want to search for any key the whole left or right subtree is discarded with a single check. This is how the time complexity is reduced to O(log(n). This change has lead to a significant improvement of HashMap.
 
		Once the number of entries is decreased due to removal or resizing of HashMap (UNTREEIFY_THRESHOLD = 6), the structure is converted back to the older implementation which is LinkedList.

Q)How Hashset works internally?
Internally, a HashSet uses a HashMap to store its elements. When you add an element to a HashSet, it actually adds the element as a key in the HashMap with a constant dummy value (HashMap.PRESENT), which acts as a placeholder.
This means that while HashSet ensures unique elements, the underlying HashMap handles the storage, retrieval, and management of these elements.

		
Q))Types of Map available in java
HashMap: offers 0(1) lookup and insertion
LinkedHashMap: LinkedHashMap offers 0(1) lookup and insertion
TreeMap: offers O(log N) lookup and insertion


Q)HashMap Vs ConcurrentHashMap Vs HashTable 
	HashMap:-
		HashMap is not synchronized there by making it better for non-threaded applications.
		Allows only one null key but any number of null in the values.
		It is fast.
		Supports order of insertion by making use of its subclass LinkedHashMap.
		Suitable for single thread appliactions.
		
	ConcurrentHashMap:-
		ConcurrentHashMap is synchronized and thread safe.
		This does not allow null in both keys or values.
		It is slow.
		Suitable for multi-thread appliactions.
		
	HashTable:-
		HashTable is synchronized and hence it is suitable for threaded applications.
		This does not allow null in both keys or values.
		It is slow
		Order of insertion is not guaranteed in HashTable.
		Suitable for multi-thread appliactions.
		It is legacy class. We can use ConcurrentHashMap instead of HashTable.
		
Q)Why does the java array index start with 0?
It is because the 0 index array avoids the extra arithmetic operation to calculate the memory address.
   
Q)BlockingQueue
BlockingQueue is a java Queue that support operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving and removing an element, and wait for space to become available in the queue when adding an element.
	a). It is always thread-safe.
	b). It can hold arbitrary data
	c). Producer has to wait if the queue is already full
	d). Consumer has to be wait if no item is present in the queue.

Q)Unmodifiable list 


Q)ImmutableList
ImmutableList<String> immutableList =  ImmutableList.of("Geeks", "For", "Geeks"); 
java 9 = List.of(1,2,3);

Q)Datastructure



Q)read and write file
FileReader and FileWriter

Q)How to read Excel file in Java
We can do this by using 3rd party library like Apache POI

Q)What is Iterator
 In Java, an iterator is an interface that is used to traverse through a collection of objects one by one.

Q)Difference between Iterator and ListIterator

Iterator
	Can traverse elements present in Collection only in the forward direction.
	Helps to traverse Map, List and Set.
	Indexes cannot be obtained by using Iterator.
	Certain methods of Iterator are hasNext(), next() and remove()
	

ListIterator
	Can traverse elements present in Collection both in forward and backward directions.
	Helps to traverse List only.
	It has methods like nextIndex() and previousIndex() to obtain indexes of elements at any time while traversing List.
	Certain methods of ListIterator are next(), previous(), hasNext(), hasPrevious(), add(E e), set(E e), nextIndex(), previousIndex().
	

Q)regex	


Q)final keywords

final variable - variable can only initialize only once. final varibale object state can be chanage, not able to change reference.
final method - final methods can't be overriden by subclass. It is useful when implementation of method remains unchange.
final class - final class can be inherit. Useful for security design to prevent inheretence.


@)static

Static class:
	->Static classes in Java are a way to group classes together & it is one of the most popular keywords associated with many things.
	->We can declare a class static by using the static keyword. A class can be declared static only if it is a nested class. It does not require any reference of the outer class. The property of the static class is that it does not allows us to access the non-static members of the outer class.
	
	->we can create a static class inside another class.
	-> Used in Builder Design

Q)can we print "Hello world" in java without using main method?
	Yes, by using static method. Here we can just compile and run java file.
	static {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        System.exit(0); // Exits the program so that the JVM doesn't look for the main method
    }

Note:-
finally() methos may not be invoke if we invoke garbage collector in middle of try or catch
finally() and finalize() method may not invoke when we exit the thread like System.exit()
System.exit() makes terminate the code

Java send signal to Interface AutoCloseable close() method during the try-with-resource to close the opened resource

Exception
Exception handle in catch block should be in order like Runtime --> Exception etc, otherwise compiletime error will be thrown
After try block catch or finally is must expected
Finally block always execute
If try, catch and finally has return statement then always finally block value will be returned. (error or non-error doesn't matter)


Q) Reflections
Reflection is commonly used by programs which require the ability to examine or modify the runtime behavior of applications running in the Java virtual machine. 


Q) Default Methods In Java 8

The default methods were introduced to provide backward compatibility so that existing interfaces can use the lambda expressions without implementing the methods in the implementation class. Default methods are also known as defender methods or virtual extension methods.
