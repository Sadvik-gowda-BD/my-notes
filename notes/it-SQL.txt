Interview SQL


Q)What is database
A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.

Q) Difference between Relational and Non-Relational Databases
	Relational Database:- Store data in table format, and each row called as record.
	Ex:- MS SQL server, MySql, Oracal Database etc

	Non-Relational Databases:- 
	A non-relational database stores data in a non-tabular form, NoSQL database technology stores information in JSON documents instead of columns and rows used by relational databases.
	Ex:- MangoDb, Cassesndra, Redis Db etc.


Q)

Sequence generator
Joins - left outer, inner joins etc
Views
stored procedure


@Lob in entity
Normalization

To revisit

GO

write view and store procedure query , it'll be easy to remember
find nth highest salary


Q)find nth heighest salary
SELECT TOP 1 Salary 
FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT TOP N Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Subquery
ORDER BY Salary ASC;


Q)Print max salary by each department with employee name

soln1:
SELECT e.name AS employee_name, e.salary, d.name AS department_name
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON e.department_id = d.id
WHERE e.salary = (SELECT MAX(e2.salary) FROM Employee e2 WHERE e2.department_id = e.department_id);

soln2:
WITH DepartmentMaxSalaries AS (
    SELECT Department, MAX(Salary) AS HighestSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY Department
)
SELECT e.EmployeeName, e.Department, e.Salary AS HighestSalary
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN DepartmentMaxSalaries dms
ON e.Department = dms.Department AND e.Salary = dms.HighestSalary; 

Soln3:
Use RANK() functions
SELECT DepartmentName, EmployeeName, Salary
FROM (
    SELECT 
        d.DepartmentName,
        e.EmployeeName,
        e.Salary,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY e.DepartmentID ORDER BY e.Salary DESC) AS Rank
    FROM Employee e
    JOIN Department d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
) RankedSalaries
WHERE Rank = 1;



Q)Print the day where temp is increased

	Select * from whether w1 where w1.temp > (select temp from whether w2 where w2.day = (w1.day-1));

	--By using joins

	SELECT 
		t1.day AS CurrentDay, 
		t1.temperature AS CurrentTemp, 
		t2.day AS PreviousDay, 
		t2.temperature AS PreviousTemp
	FROM 
		weather t1
	JOIN 
		weather t2 
		ON t1.day = DATEADD(day, 1, t2.day)  -- t1 is the day after t2
	WHERE 
		t1.temperature > t2.temperature;     -- temp increased
		
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	Select w2.day from whether w1 
	join whether w2 on (w1.day+1) = w2.day
	where w2.temp > w1.temp

	Note:- when W1=1 then W2=2

P)In SQL Server, the WITH clause is used to define a Common Table Expression (CTE). A CTE is a temporary result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. It is similar to creating a temporary table, but it's only available for the duration of the query it is defined in.
	
Q)How database index works
When you create an index on a column, you’re creating a new table with two columns: one for the column you indexed on, and another for the pointer to the record it relates to.
This index structure is then sorted, allowing Binary Searches to be performed on it. As a result, your query is O Log(n) efficient compare to linear search O(N/2)
	

Q)Difference between 1st and 2nd level cache

In hibernate session factory configuration details will be in hibernate.cfg.xml file then  
SessionFactory sessionFactoty = new Configuration().configure("hibernate.cfg.xml").buildSessionFactory();

1st level cache
	->By default in hibernate
	->First Level cache is associated with the Session object
	->mandatory and for only one session, once the session is closed it will be removed from cache.
	For Ex:- in a session if get user id 101 data and if I fetch same data again and again it won't hit database multiple time hit only once, it returns from the L1 cache.
	
	Session session = sessionFactoty.openSession();
	session.get(UserDetails.class, 101); //hit database
	session.get(UserDetails.class, 101); //won't hit database return data from cache
	session.close();
	
	
2nd level cache
	->We have to implement manually
	->Second Level Cache is associated with the Session Factory object
	->optional and shared by all sessions
	
	Ex: By default L2 cache will be diabled, we can enable by below property
		<property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache">true</property>
        <property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class">org.hibernate.cache.jcache.JCacheRegionFactory</property>
        <property name="hibernate.javax.cache.provider">org.ehcache.jsr107.EhcacheCachingProvider</property>


Q)Databse lock
	P)Pessimistic Locking
		Pessimistic locking assumes that conflicts will happen when multiple transactions access the same data, so it locks the data resource preemptively. It prevents other transactip toons from modifying the data until the current transaction is complete.
		->Locks the record immediately when a transaction reads it.
		->No other transaction can read or write the locked data until the lock is released (usually after the transaction completes).
		->Comes with a performance cost, as other transactions are blocked, and deadlocks may occur if not managed properly.
		->In SQL Server, you can use row-level locks with the SELECT FOR UPDATE clause (in databases that support it).
		EX:
			@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)
			@Query("SELECT a FROM Application a WHERE a.id = :id")
			Application findByIdWithLock(Long id);

	P)Optimistic Locking
		Optimistic locking assumes that conflicts are rare. Instead of locking the data at the time of reading, optimistic locking allows transactions to proceed without locking, but it checks for conflicts before committing the transaction.
		->No locks are placed when reading or modifying data.
		->The transaction checks if the data was modified by another transaction before committing the changes. If another transaction has modified the data, the current transaction is rolled back.
		->Uses a version number or timestam detect changes in the data.
		EX:
			@Version
			private Integer version; // Version field for optimistic locking



Q)Pagination query

SELECT * from STUDENT ORDER BY CREATE_DATE OFFSET (@Page_Number-1)* @PageSize FETCH NEXT @PageSize

//OFFSET - starting row
//LIMIT or FETCH NEXT - Number of records to return after OFFSET


P)Order of execution
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
SELECT
ORDER BY
LIMIT/TOP

Q)Why SQL over no sql?
Well-suited for structured data with relationships.	
Strong support for ACID transactions.
Joins and Complex Queries

---------------------------------MONGODB

MongoDb

P)JSON
only 6 data types - String, Number, Object, Array, Boolean, Null

Ex:-
{
	"id": 101,
	"type":"Phone",
	"price":120,
	"inStock":true,
	"features":["wifi","5g","HD camera"],
	"others":null
}

P)BSON / Binary JSON

->BSON is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON documents, and includes all JSON data structure types
->All documents in MongoDb stores in the format of BSON

Common BSON types
String, Object, Array, Boolean, Integer NumberInt(50), Double, ObjectId("xyz"), Date ISODate("2018-....)

To start mongo shell
>mongosh


To check service is running or not
netstat -an | findstr 27017


> db.version()

> show dbs
> use testdb //testdb won't be created until we create any collections

> show collections

//Create collections
> db.createCollection("collection_name")

-----Insert data into collection db.Collection_name or db.getCollection(Collection_name)

>db.Collection_name.insertOne({Name: "Akshay", Marks: 500})

or

//create variable and use that variable during insertion
>const val1 = {Name: "Akshay", Marks: 500};
>db.Collection_name.insertOne(val1)

>db.Collection_name.insertMany([{name:"Ajay",age:20},
                       {name:"Bina",age:24},
                       {name:"Ram",age:23}])

//Or

>db.Collection_name.insert(
<document or [document1, document2,...]>,
{
    writeConcern: <document>,
    ordered: <boolean>
})


------------Read Operations
>db.getCollection('collection_name').find()
>db.Collection_name.findOne()

//Get all the data from collection
>db.yourCollectionName.find()

//get data based on key value pair
>db.yourCollectionName.find({age:20})
>db.yourCollectionName.find({"address.city":"Bengaluru"}) //for embedded variable "" is mandatory like "address.city"


---------query operators

$or, $and, $eq, $neq, $lt, $gt,$gte, $in, $nin, $regex etc

//age > 20
>db.Collection_name.find({"age":{$gt:20}})

//name="Ram" && age>20
>db.Collection_name.find({$and:[{name:"Ram"}, {age:{$gt:20}}]})

//name in 
>db.Collection_name.find({name:{$in:["Ajay","Vijay"]}});

------------Helper methods
sort(), limit(), skip()

>db.Collection_name.find().skip(2).sort({age:1}).limit(3);
> db.Collection_name.find().sort({age:1}); // value should be 1 or -1. 1=ascending order, -1=descending order
> db.Collection_name.find().skip(2)

----update
We can use update function to update or addd new fields

db.COLLECTION_NAME.update({SELECTION_CRITERIA}, {$set:{UPDATED_DATA}}, {
     upsert: <boolean>,
     multi: <boolean>,
     writeConcern: <document>,
     collation: <document>,
     arrayFilters: [ <filterdocument1>, ... ],
     hint:  <document|string>        
   })

//updateOne() is a method that is used to update a single document that matches a specified filter.
>db.Collection_name.updateOne({name: "Annu"}, {$set:{age:25}});

//The MongoDB updateMany is used to update multiple documents in a collection that match a specified filter. This method allows us to apply updates to all documents that meet the criteria defined in the filter.
>db.Collection_name.updateMany({age:18},{$set:{eligible:"true"}})

---delete

//Delete only one doc which is first
>db.Collection_name.deleteOne({name:"Ram"});
>db.Collection_name.deleteMany({name:"Ram"})
>db.Collection_name.deleteMany({age: {$lt:20}})


---MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline
Aggregation in MongoDB is a powerful feature that allows for complex data transformations and computations on collections of documents. It enables users to group, filter, and manipulate data to produce summarized results.

//To get all unique ages
>db.Collection_name.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$age"}}])

//print group by age and count the records
>db.Collection_name.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$age", count: {$sum:1}}}])


--indexes

>db.Collection_name.getIndexes()




----Others

//count of documents in collections
>db.Collection_name.countDocuments(); //output is 8
>db.Collection_name.aggregate([{ $count: "totalDocumentsCount" }]); //output is [ { totalDocumentsCount: 8 } ]
