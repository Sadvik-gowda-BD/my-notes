Q)How many times in a day does the clock's hand overlap?
Ans:- 11*2 = 22

The hands of a clock overlap approximately every 65 minutes.
In a 12-hour period, the hands overlap 11 times.
Therefore, in a full 24-hour period, the hands overlap 22 times.
The overlap occurs slightly less than every hour because, after each overlap, the minute hand catches up to the hour hand again a bit faster.

Q)You have only two vessels of 3l and 5l volume, and you are given an unending water supply. How can you get 4l of water by using these two vessels?

	Fill the 5-liter vessel completely.

	Now you have 5 liters in the 5-liter vessel.
	Pour water from the 5-liter vessel into the 3-liter vessel until the 3-liter vessel is full.

	Now you have 3 liters in the 3-liter vessel and 2 liters remaining in the 5-liter vessel.
	Empty the 3-liter vessel.

	Now the 3-liter vessel is empty, and you still have 2 liters in the 5-liter vessel.
	Pour the 2 liters from the 5-liter vessel into the 3-liter vessel.

	Now you have 2 liters in the 3-liter vessel and the 5-liter vessel is empty.
	Fill the 5-liter vessel again.

	Now you have 5 liters in the 5-liter vessel.
	Pour water from the 5-liter vessel into the 3-liter vessel until the 3-liter vessel is full.

	Since the 3-liter vessel already has 2 liters in it, you can only add 1 more liter to it (to make it full).
	Now you have 3 liters in the 3-liter vessel and 4 liters remaining in the 5-liter vessel.
	Now, you have exactly 4 liters of water in the 5-liter vessel.
