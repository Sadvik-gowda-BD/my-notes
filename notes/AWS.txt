Private IP
	Always assigned
	It is used for internal communication.
	Does not change even if you restart the instance.
Public IP
	It is Optional
	It is needed to access service via internet.
	Changes if the instance is stopped and restarted.
	Assigned only if the EC2 is in a public subnet.





S3:
	->It is a cloud storage container used to store and manage data objects.
	->It is a global service, and all S3 buckets are accessible over the internet. So can't able to create this service inside VPC.
	->Stores data as objects rather than files or blocks.
	->It can store any type of like image, video, zip, jar etc.
	->Supports IAM policies, bucket policies, and ACLs for permissions.
	->Versioning: Keeps multiple versions of objects to prevent accidental deletions
	->Event Notifications: Can trigger AWS Lambda, SNS, or SQS on changes.

	Limit:
		Maximum object size: 5TB
		Single upload limit (PUT operation): 5GB
		Multipart upload limit: Up to 5TB (Recommended for files larger than 100MB)
		Minimum part size for multipart upload: 5MB (except the last part)
		
		
Subnet:
	A subnet is created by dividing an IP network into smaller parts using a Subnet Mask.

	Imagine a company office with multiple departments:
		HR Department (Handles employee records)
		IT Department (Manages servers, networks)
		Finance Department (Deals with payroll, accounts)

	Each department has computers, printers, and other network devices. If all devices were in one large network, issues could arise:
	❌ Network Congestion – Too many devices sending data in one network → slower internet speeds.
	❌ Security Risks – Any employee could access confidential finance data.
	❌ Broadcast Storms – When every device sends messages to every other device → overload.

	✅ How Subnets Solve This Problem?
	The company divides its network into three subnets, one for each department:

	Department	Subnet (CIDR)		IP Range
	HR			192.168.1.0/24	192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254
	IT			192.168.2.0/24	192.168.2.1 - 192.168.2.254
	Finance		192.168.3.0/24	192.168.3.1 - 192.168.3.254

Route Table:
A Route Table in AWS is a set of rules (routes) that determine how network traffic flows within a VPC

The table contains two colums:
	1)Destination → Defines where the traffic is going (for ex source EC2 instance try to access 192.0.7.1 IP then 192.0.7.1 is destination).
	2)Target → Where the traffic should be sent (e.g., IGW, NAT Gateway, another subnet, or VPN). For ex if source instance request to 192.0.7.1 IP then route to target IP nat-123456 (NAT Gateway).

VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a private, isolated network within AWS where you can launch and manage your AWS resources (like EC2, RDS, Lambda, etc.). It behaves like a traditional data center network, but in the cloud.

->✅ Route table is automatically created when you create a VPC.
->  A default local route (10.0.0.0/16 local): Allows communication between resources inside the VPC.

	VPC Peering:
		It is a networking connection between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) that allows them to communicate privately without send request to Internet.

	Public Subnet 
	->Allows direct internet access.
	Ex:- Backend services, databases, private APIs


	Private Subnet
	Restricted from direct internet access.
	Ex:- Hosting public-facing applications (web servers, ALB)

VPC endpoints: 
	It allows instances in your VPC to privately connect to AWS services (like S3, DynamoDB, SQS, etc.) without using the public internet.
	For ex S3 always available by public internet, if I need to access privately then VPC endpoints can be used.
		✔ No Internet Gateway (IGW) required, No need for public IPs, reducing attack surface.
		✔ No NAT Gateway needed for private subnets
		✔ More secure & lower latency since traffic stays within AWS
	
	AWS provides two types of VPC Endpoints:
		1) Gateway Endpoint: 
			Connect VPC to S3 & DynamoDB only.
			Uses Route Table
		2) Interface Endpoint: 
			Connect VPC to other AWS services (SQS, SNS, etc.).
			Uses Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

Inbound traffic = Internet users can access your public EC2 instance.
Outbound traffic =  EC2 instances can make requests to the internet.


NAT: Network Address Translation Gateway
	It allows instances in a private subnet to access the internet securely without exposing them to inbound internet traffic.
	only one-way traffic: outbound traffic
	Ex: Private EC2 instances can download updates, access external APIs, download security patch etc.

ALB: Application Load Balancer
	By using ALB, we can access private subnet EC2 instance from Internet
	Handles Inbound traffic
	
	
Firewall:
	NACL: Network access controll list
		It is a security layer in AWS that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
		Supports both Allow & Deny rules (explicitly block traffic).
		Applies to all instances in a subnet.
		Stateless → Each request is evaluated separately.
		Ex: You want to block traffic at the subnet level (e.g., block SSH to all EC2 instances in a subnet).

	
	Security Groups:
		An instance-level firewall (applies to EC2, RDS, etc.).
		Only Allow rules (No explicit deny).
		Stateful → If an inbound request is allowed, the response is automatically allowed.
		Ex: You need instance-level security (e.g., allow SSH only from a specific IP).
		


Question:
What is again public and private in VPC structure?
